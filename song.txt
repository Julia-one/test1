You keep dreaming and dark scheming
Yeah, you do
You're a poison and I know that is the truth
All my friends think you're vicious
And they say you're suspicious
You keep dreaming and dark scheming
Yeah, you do


I feel like I'm drowning
I'm drowning
You're holding me down and
Holding me down
You're killing me slow
So slow, oh-no
I feel like I'm drowning
I'm drowning


You're so plastic and that's tragic
Just for you
I don't know what the hell you gonna do
When your looks start depleting
And your friends all start leaving
You're so plastic and that's tragic
Just for you
